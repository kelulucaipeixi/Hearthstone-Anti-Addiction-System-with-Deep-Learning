# Hearthstone Anti-Addiction-System with Deep Learning


## To Train

run <br><pre><code>python train.py</code></pre><br> to train the model, and the dateset can be your owns. Like I use the hearthstone screenshots and normal website screenshots as trainset, so it can be a detector to distinguish whether the screenshot is from hearthstone, which however, shows whether you are playing the hearthstone game.
run <br><pre><code>python detector.py</code></pre><br> to execute the detector. And first time you run it, this software will write key values into the registry. Which means this 'anti-addiction-system' software will run automatically every time you open your computer.

<b>Note:</b> if you play hearthstone over 30 minutes, this software will remind you. And also it will remind you every 30 minutes when you are playing the game. If you play hearthstone over 2 hours a day, this softwarew will close the game immediately and you can't open the hearthstone anymore until the next day.
